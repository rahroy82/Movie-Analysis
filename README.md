# Greenlight Analytics — Phase 2 Project

This project analyzes movie industry data from Box Office Mojo and the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Its purpose is to provide insights that lead to actionable recommendations for decision-makers. The intended audience is the head of a new movie studio and its shareholders, who are seeking evidence-based strategies to guide the selection and release of films.

Two primary data sources form the foundation of the analysis. Box Office Mojo contributed detailed information on domestic and foreign grosses in CSV format, while IMDb supplied structured data on movie basics and ratings through a SQLite database. These datasets were merged using shared identifiers such as title, primary title, year, start year, and movie ID. Before analysis began, the data underwent careful preparation: duplicate records were removed, rows with critical missing values were dropped, foreign grosses were converted to numeric values with missing entries set to zero, and a new column for total gross was created by combining domestic and foreign grosses. This process ensured a consistent and reliable dataset ready for exploration.

The first business question asked which genres and runtimes are most successful. Results showed that Action, Adventure, and Fantasy films repeatedly deliver the highest box office revenues. Both mean and median grosses were calculated across genres, while scatter plots illustrated the relationship between runtime and audience ratings. A clear pattern emerged: runtimes between ninety-five and one hundred and twenty minutes tended to be associated with stronger audience reception and commercial success.

The second question explored whether ratings correlate with revenue. Scatter plots and regression analysis revealed that higher IMDb ratings often align with stronger box office performance. Because grosses vary dramatically across films—from small independent releases to billion-dollar blockbusters—a logarithmic scale was applied to the revenue axis to clarify the patterns. This adjustment made it possible to see that audience and critical approval can play a measurable role in financial outcomes.

The third question investigated how domestic and foreign markets differ by studio. Aggregating grosses at the studio level highlighted distinct differences in how companies balance domestic versus international audiences. Stacked bar charts provided a clear comparison of studios that rely primarily on domestic earnings with those that draw more heavily from foreign markets. Such distinctions underline the importance of tailoring release strategies to each studio’s strengths and target demographics.

Taken together, these findings point to several recommendations. Studios should focus on genres with a consistent record of high returns, particularly Action, Adventure, and Fantasy. Attention to runtime is also warranted, with films in the ninety-five to one hundred and twenty minute range offering a strong balance of audience engagement and commercial appeal. Release strategies must consider the unique revenue profiles of domestic and international markets, ensuring that marketing and distribution efforts align with the strengths of each studio. Finally, because higher ratings are linked to stronger performance, investment in creative and production choices that enhance quality and audience satisfaction should remain a priority.

The analysis was carried out in Python using pandas, numpy, and sqlite3 for data management, with matplotlib and seaborn handling visualization. Box Office Mojo provided CSV data, while IMDb offered a SQLite database. To reproduce the analysis, clone this repository, install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt, and place the files `bom.movie_gross.csv.gz` and `im.db` in the project directory. Once the environment is prepared, the analysis can be run by opening the Jupyter notebook `notebook.ipynb`.

In summary, this project demonstrates how combining box office data with audience ratings can generate practical business insights. By identifying the genres, runtimes, and release strategies most strongly associated with financial success, the results provide clear guidance for a new movie studio seeking to maximize its competitive advantage.
